        "## 2.1) Business overview.\n",
        "Getting feedback from application users is a crucial aspect of growth as it gives a deeper understanding of user sentiment, improves content moderation, and informs product and service improvements. Our project utilizes the Google AI GoEmotions dataset to expand emotion classification datasets, improving chatbot sensitivity, online behavior detection, and customer support. By training neural networks and SVM models to analyze text tonality, we advance emotion analysis in NLP, benefiting stakeholders such as chatbot system providers, online platforms, and customer support departments. Our project's enhanced emotion analysis addresses this real-world problem of limited sensitivity and understanding, leading to more empathetic interactions, improved content moderation, and optimized customer support, ultimately enhancing user experiences.\n",

        "Expand emotion classification datasets by training models to analyze text tonality using the Google AI GoEmotions dataset.</br>\n",
        "**Specific Objectives**</br>\n",
        "a) Develop a model to classify text data into different sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed sentiments.</br>\n",
        "b) To establish the most appropriate model amongst the ones chosen, to accurately predict sentiments.</br>\n",
        "c) Improve customer support by recognizing and addressing user emotions in textual communication.</br>\n",

        "The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/go-emotions-google-emotions-dataset?select=go_emotions_dataset.csv), [hover above to go to the dataset.].The dataset has 31 columns, the *id,text,example_very_unclear and various emotions*.The Google AI GoEmotions dataset contains labeled comments from Reddit users expressing diverse emotions. This dataset is suitable for training neural networks to analyze text tonality, as it provides a comprehensive emotional spectrum and allows for subtle differentiation among various emotions. The dataset includes detailed emotional annotations and descriptive statistics, facilitating the analysis of emotions in text. While there may be limitations such as potential biases and subjective categorization, the GoEmotions dataset remains valuable for enhancing chatbot sensitivity, detecting online hazards, and improving customer support through the analysis of diverse emotions.\n",
